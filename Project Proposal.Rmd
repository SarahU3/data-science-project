## Project Proposal: Predicting Divorce for Young Adults
In the past X years/decades, American views on love, sex, marriage, and divorce have underwent drastic change. Though the 1960s featured hippies, Woodstock, sexual freedom, and the infamous 'Summer of Love,' the popularity of casual sex gave way to greater conservatism with the end of the Vietnam war, the growing [politicization of sex](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19053382/ns/health-sexual_health/t/free-love-was-there-price-pay/), skyrocketing rates of STDs, and the subsequent HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

However, within the past decade, perceptions of sex, marriage, and love have transformed again. On college campuses, research and discussions about the 'hook-up culture,' are rife. Young adults' fears of commitment are partially blamed on the exponentially wider pool of potential mates, supported by the introduction of mobile dating apps and online matchmaking services. The logic goes, 'Why settle when you can always potentially have more? Casual sex - in the form of one-night stands, "hook-up buddies," "friends-with-benefits," and the like - requires less commitment.

###(1) Hypothesis and Research Questions 
Research question: What types of people are most likely to divorce? 
We expect that certain social and political views affect the health and length of a marriage. Those characteristics will allow us to predict who is most likely to get a divorce or remain married. 


###(2) Data Experiment Design 
For married individuals ages 25 to 45, we will predict the probability of getting a divorce within the first seven years of marriage based on the respondent's social views and history, include attitudes about pornography, fundamentalism of religious views, and instances of premarital sex or extra-marital sex. Our analysis will also use standard factors such as education, race, religion, political views and having children. 

###(3) Data
We will use data from the General Social Survey from years 1990 to 2014, approximately a generational cohort. The data is available as a cumulative file of cross-sectional samples from all years 1972 to 2014, but we are limiting our selection based on the availability of specific variables. 

###(4) Proposed Processing Methods
Using the train-validate-test method, we will separate our available data in to a 70-15-15 split. 

###(5) Proposed Analytical Methods
We will test three methods of analyzing the data for predictions:
1. Logistic regression
2. Decision trees
3. Random forest

Based on the accuracy results of each method, we will determine the best model for prediction and apply that for our insight. 

###(6) Ethical Considerations 
This could affect real-life relationships, depending on how the results are used, especially if marriage counselors included it as a tool in their work. Unfortunately, someone might be influenced to consider a divorce who wouldn't have or a couple might not get married who had thought about it, if the prediction indicates that their marriage is unlikely to last. On the other hand, this could provide support for dating services that cater to those looking for long-term relationships by identifying personal factors that contribute to marriage longevity.
