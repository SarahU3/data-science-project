## Project Proposal: Predicting Divorce for Young Adults

(1) the hypothesis and research questions 
For people age 25 to 45, we will predict divorce using standard factors such as education, race, age when married, years married, religion, political views and having children. However, we will also include attitudes about pornography, instances of premarital sex, premarital sex as a teenager and extra-marital sex. 
Research question: What types of people are most likely to divorce?

(2) data experiment design 


(3) the data
We will use data from the General Social Survey from years 1990 to 2014. The data is available as a cumulative file of cross-sectional samples from all years in SPSS or Stata formats, so we will need to convert it to R. 


(4) proposed processing methods
Using the train-validate-test method, we will separate our available data in to a 70-15-15 split. 

(5) proposed analytical methods
We will test three methods of analyzing the data for predictions:
1. Logistic regression
2. Decision trees
3. Random forest

(6) ethical considerations of such a project
