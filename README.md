Project Title: Bad Romance? 
<i> Predicting Marriage/Divorce Outcomes in Young Couples </i> 

Synopsis/Overview: 
Given the evolving discourse and perspectives on marriage, we seek to predict the probability that a couple will get a divorce within the first seven years of marriage based on social views, attitudes about pornography, fundamentalism of religious views, and instances of premarital sex or extra-marital sex.  Using data from the General Social Survey, we will train an algorithm on a generational cohort from the years 1990-2014 to determine which types of respondents are most likely to experience divorce. Because some features may not be enough to explain or predict divorce outcomes, we will consider conducting a hierarchical clustering analysis to develop typologies or profiles that can be used to simplify how we assess the different levels of risk of divorce for each respondent. As stated in our proposal, we will test three methods of analyzing the data for predictions: (1) logistic regression, (2) decision trees, and (3) random forest. Based on the accuracy results of each method, we will determine the best model for prediction.
